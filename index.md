# About
I am a machine learning research engineer at Samsung AI Center. I’m currently working on various projects involving large language models, indoor localization, and wireless communications. Before joining Samsung, I worked as an ML engineer in different countries focusing on deploying computer vision models on devices.

I received an M.S. in Data Science from the University of Paris Dauphine in 2016 and an M.Sc. in Machine Learning and Wireless Communication from the University of Manitoba in 2021. During my Master's, I focused on using reinforcement learning techniques to solve wireless communication problems.

For the full list of my publications, please check my Google Scholar profile. Please feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate. I’m always interested in working on new research problems.
